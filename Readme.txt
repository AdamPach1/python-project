Welcome to my Github repository,

Within this portfolio, I have curated two projects to demonstrate my proficiency as a Data Analyst.

The 'ProtfolioProject2.ipynb' file encapsulates my expertise in utilizing Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries. It showcases detailed analyses, including trend analysis facilitated through correlation functions.

Additionally, 'slot_machine.py' exemplifies my adeptness in employing fundamental Python concepts and functions within a practical project.
